		MindShaft Games is an independent game studio out of Seymour, CT, founded in 2013 by Nicholas DiMucci. Nicholas DiMucci has been making games since 2009 and is currently hard at work on MindShaft Games first major release, Demons with Shotguns. The goal with MindShaft Games is simple. To make games we really want to play, and hope others want to play too!

		<history>
			<header>Early history</header>
			<text>After a short stunt as a filmmaker, in 2009 Nicholas DiMucci began to pursue a graduate degree in Computer Science. During that time, he joined a Half-Life 2 mod team as a designer/writer (which would later disband), created Unreal Tournament 3 maps, and programmed horrible games that's best left out of the public eye. Two years later, he graduated with full honors and obtained a typical software development job.</text>

		<history>
			<header>After that</header>
			<text>While working full-time as a software developer, Nicholas DiMucci continued developing games in his spare time. After participating in a few game jams, his Ludum Dare 26 entry planted the seed for the idea for Demons with Shotguns, which quickly began to swell inside his brain. To relieve the pressure, he began to flesh out the idea and would start development of it during the Summer of 2013, forming MindShaft Games in the process.</text>
