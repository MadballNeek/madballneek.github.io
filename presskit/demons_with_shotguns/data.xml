	<description>
	The battle between Heaven and Hell has been going on for so long, no one really remembers why, let alone when, it started. Alas, both sides are desperate for souls that can be used to strengthen their numbers. Their desperation takes them to the mortal realm, where Angels and Demons fight for the souls of mankind. Up to four players will fight against each other in multiple game modes to help tip the scales in their factions favor. Armed with a powerful double barrel shotgun, blast your way through your opponents, unleashing their souls for to you collect, and bathe in the rain of their blood and gibs!

	<history>
	I've always loved competitive multiplayer games, growing up games like Unreal Tournament, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D. Sometime in early 2012, after playing the classic Super Mario Bros. Battle with some friends, the idea of developing a local 4-player multiplayer game in similar vain has always stuck with me since. Fast forward to early 2013, after creating a Unreal Tournament demake for the Ludum Dare game jam, I decided to take the idea of "Unreal Tournament on SNES" and run with it. After many design iterations, the idea ultimatly morphed into what you're seeing today.
